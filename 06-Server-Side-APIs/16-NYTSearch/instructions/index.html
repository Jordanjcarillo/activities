        <h1>NY Times Mini Project</h1>
        <p>In preparation for our start of project #1, we are going to build a mini-project with our team 
            this morning</p>

        <h2>1.0 GOAL</h2>
        Our end goal is to use the NYT API to get articles and display them in an elegant bootstrap-layout 
        similar to this:
        <img src="assets/layout1.jpg" style='width:25vw;' />
        <img src="assets/layout2.jpg" style='width:25vw;' />
        <hr />
        The working URL for the <a href='../Solved/index.html'>final app</a>.
        <br /><hr />
        <h1>2.0 BUILD PLAN (20 mins)</h1>
        <p>To tackle this project there will likely be 3 key phrases</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Do a cursory review of the overall app: what's happening?</li>
            <li>What resources are needed (bootstrap? anything else?) </li>
            <li>What is the API being used? Do you need to register? Examine the API (hint see section 2.1)</li>
            <li>Plan the steps to build:</li>
            <li>a) Wireframe out the logic - user will type search parameters, then ajax call, then display </li>
            <li>b) Have some of your team start building the HTML, put in placeholder results.</li>
            <li>c) Have other members of your team do the API-call tests</li>
            <li>d) Build components, test, merge them, test/debug overall app.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>2.1 API (10 mins)</h2>
        <p>Take some time to examine the API and talk about it. The overview page 
            shows the 
            <a href='https://developer.nytimes.com/docs/articlesearch-product/1/overview'>articlesearch.json</a> call that we will be using.
        </p>
        <p>All the parameters are in this link: <a href='https://developer.nytimes.com/docs/articlesearch-product/1/routes/articlesearch.json/get'>https://developer.nytimes.com/docs/articlesearch-product/1/routes/articlesearch.json/get</a>
        </p>
        <br /><hr />
        <h1>3.0 BUILD HTML UI (90 mins)</h1>
        <p>Build the initial UI, and remember to have input boxes to capture the fields 
            needed in the demo. 
        </p>
        <p>Once built, wire up the capturing of inputs and display them in the console.log</p>
        <p>Once this is ready, now try to build the Query string needed for the call. The team 
            member who tested out the API parameters should be involved here.
        </p>
        <p>Examine the API data and wire-up the result output to show the matching data.</p>
        <p><b>Remember to use a LOT of console.log comments to understand what is happening at each step of AJAX call.</b></p>
        <h1>4.0 CELEBRATE</h1>
        <p>Congratulations on tackling a challenging project like! Enjoy lunch, and we'll 
            announce teams when we are back!
        </p>
